# NetVis

Neural Network visualizer (with PyTorch integration)

There have been many approaches for this before, but most of them are 2D and very large.
(See the following threads:
[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52468956/how-do-i-visualize-a-net-in-pytorch),
[2](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/how-to-visualize-draw-a-model/176263),
[3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8085520/generating-pdf-latex-with-python-script)
[4](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/885/how-can-i-use-latex-from-python)
.)
The resulting output are unsuitable for use in papers or presentation.
This library aims to create a simple, clean and easy to use visualizer for neural networks.

## Setup

Using python 3.12

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Roadmap

- [ ] Latex templates
- [ ] Python Templates (jinja+latex or pylatex?)
- [ ] Useful API
- [ ] PyTorch integration
